Edit Assets (True-Assets)The 'Edit assets' function for True-Assets is designed to provide an easy way for users to be able to access the asset (Object, Material, Collection etc) and make changes to that asset so that those changes will be used going forward. Example use-cases of this:You've noticed an issue with the topology of an object, and don't want to keep changing it every time you bring the asset in. Use the edit Asset function to address the issue at the source so future use of the asset will not use the old broken topologyYou've noticed that an object is coming in with the wrong scale for some reason. Use the edit Asset function to change and then apply the scale at the source so future use of the asset will be at the correct scaleA material that you've saved as an asset may have missing textures. Use the edit Asset function to re-link the textures so future use of the asset will not have missing texturesYou should use this feature if you wish to fix any issues that you see, or wish to make changes to the asset. Bear-in-mind that this is a destructive process and all changes will be permanent.Making changesOnce you have made changes in the source file, you MUST save the file. You do not use the save-as feature, just the normal save function and close the blend-file that you made changes in. Then you need to refresh the asset-browser with the little refresh iconRename AssetsThe 'Rename Assets' function, allows you to either quickly add a prefix (something to the beginning) or a suffix (something to the end) of selected assets (single or batch) and manually replace the current name of the asset too.When you have a selection of assets (either single, or multiple) and use the rename function, a floating window will appear for you to input text to make changes.Single asset renameIf you have only one asset selected for rename, then a box will appear with the option for a prefix, suffix and then you'll see the "old name/s" (current name) and an input box for what you want the new name to be.Prefix will append characters or words to the beginning of the current nameSuffix will append characters or words to the end of the current nameNew name will replace the current nameFor example, if you have the object named as "Tree" and apply the prefix "True-VFX_" and the suffix "_LOD1" then this will change the name of the object from "Tree" to "True-VFX_Tree_LOD1"Multiple assets renameIf you have only multiple assets selected for rename, then a box will appear with the option for a prefix, suffix and then you'll see a list of  "old name/s" (current name) and an input boxes for what you want the new names to be.Prefix will append characters or words to the beginning of the current nameSuffix will append characters or words to the end of the current nameNew names will replace the current namesFor example, if you have multiple objects named different things, and you wish to standardise these like we do, then you would use a distinguishing prefix like "True-VFX_" then press okay, and your list of objects would now be renamed with the changes. Old NamesNew namesCube.001True-VFX_Cube.001Tree.001True-VFX_Tree.001Tree.002True-VFX_Tree.002Suzanne.001True-VFX_Suzanne.001Robot_Final.001True-VFX_Robot_Final.001Car_Audi_Final_SeriousFinal03True-VFX_Car_Audi_Final_SeriousFinal03ReallyWithTheseNames?.001True-VFX_ReallyWithTheseNames?.001CaveatsThings to be aware ofRename function will NOT automatically numerate (001/002/003etc) any renamed assets. If you rename a batch, they will ALL have matching names. Blender will auto-number assets when brought into the scene.Rename function is not designed as a fix for bad/poor naming.Rename function will ONLY rename object names, material names, collection names. It cannot rename mesh dataRename function does NOT rename any of the meta data for assets. You should use the "update asset data" function for thisThis is a destructive process. Renaming cannot be undone as the process happens inside the source file which is updated and saved and closed automatically. No history is stored for this!Update Asset DataThe 'Update Asset Data' function is designed to allow the management of Asset-Browser meta-data like tags, descriptions, and Author. This function will amend ALL the selected assets under this process. This process doesn't have any kind of logic to provide context aware descriptions or tags. For example, if you select 5 totally different assets (Trees, cars, buildings) It will NOT know that they are different and cannot selectively tag based on what that asset is. This is a manual process and user-intent is how this process will update the data.TagsThere is no character or word limit on tags. Tags must be separated by a comma (,) if you wish to add multiple tags. You can use spaces and any other character in the words for tags, however a comma will AWLAYS break tags up.Conventionally, you should use separate words to tag things. for example if you wish to tag a selection of tall buildings, then you should not use the tag [Tall Buildings]; you should tag it like this: [Tall],[Building]. Now when you search for Tall OR Building, then they can be indexed correctly and shown to you in a logical manner.Replace or AddThis toggle is for Tags only! This will allow you to batch replace all tags on an asset, or batch add to current tags on an asset.AuthorThis can be any length, but should be used to identify who made the asset. If the asset already has an Author then using whether you have Replace or Add selected, the Author will always be replaced/overwritten. DescriptionThis input box is for adding descriptions to assets. Again this needs user-intent and cannot be dynamic. Whatever you put in this input box, will also always replace the current description that is there. Clear Assets (True-Assets)This function is designed for removing assets, specifically selected/selections of assets.You will need to have assets selected to use this function, or you will not be given the option to use it. If you wish to delete specific types of assets, then use the "Clear Assets by Type (True-Assets)" function.Delete DataThis will specifically delete the the actual asset file, and not just unmark it as an asset. For example, using this function on object "cube.001" if you check Delete Data, then the cube object will be deleted. If you do not, then the asset will just be cleared (un-asseted) but will remain in the blend file as an object.Delete Linked DataThis will remove any materials, textures, node-groups etc from that asset. For example, if you had object "cube.001" and this had a material on called "material.001" using textures called "textures.001" then bot the material, and those textures would also be deleted from the source file of the asset. Leaving this unchecked could leave those as residual files in that blend file.Delete Blend file if no other asset is found!This does exactly what it says on the tin. If the blend file that houses assets is now completely "asset" free, then the blend file will also be deleted. This is a destructive process, and will delete the blend file even if there is other data in it. If that data is not an "asset" then it is deemed irrelevant and the file will be deleted anyway.
