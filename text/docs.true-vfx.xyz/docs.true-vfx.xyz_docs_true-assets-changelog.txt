V1 through 3Prior to version 3.1, True-Assets development was marked by a period of rapid experimentation and exploration. As a result, the team was constantly iterating on features and implementing changes in a fast-paced environment. With the focus on moving quickly and innovating, documentation took a backseat. While this approach can yield exciting results, it also means that tracking changes and documenting them in a formal way often fell by the wayside. As such, there are no official changelogs available for earlier versions of the software. However, the development team has since recognized the importance of thorough documentation and made it a priority moving forward.But let's be honest, we humans have a tendency to forget things anyway, so who knows if a changelog would have made much of a difference. Just don't ask us what we had for lunch yesterday!V3.1NEW:FBX support for batch asset creationOBJ support for batch asset creationMaterial and World shader options added to the N-PanelBatch update asset dataadd/change tagsadd/change authoradd/change descriptionsremove asset data (tags, author, descriptions)Collection supportSupport for different World texture typesHDR addedJPG addedPNG addedOption for searching Sub-folders added so you can choose to disable this if needed (happened regardless before)Fix Kitbash setsRemove Subsurf modifiersChanged displacement typeFIXES:Fixed a bug that caused issues with nested foldersFixed issues with catalogs not saving correctlyCan now delete catalogsFixed and issue with some assets appearing in the "unassigned section"Fixed an issue with Kitbash assets not saving the texturesFixed an issue with textures not being pathed correctly in generalFixed an issue for HDRis not loadingGeneral code optimisationsV3.2NEW:Added pack images optionAdded "move origin to the bottom" option on import from directory/blend file functionsFilter function to asset creation tools so users can only create from files that have a keyword in their namesSupport for "better FBX" addon (if installed, then you can choose blender internal, or BFBX importer)Batch add Prefix and Suffix to asset namesCustom material values for "create materials" option (can now set values by default on the creation process)FIXES:Issue with large objects not rendering in iconsIssue with objects not rendering due to being disabled for render in the source fileBetter logic for searching for and applying materials for FBX and OBJ file creationGeneral bug fixes for Blender 3.3 and 3.4xV4.0NEW:AmbientCG integrationHDRIsTexturesCatalogs for AmbientCGTags for all AmbientCG assetsDownload toggle (Shows downloaded assets from AmbientCG)Updated shadersUberOrganicPlasticDefaultNew shaders designed for AmbientCG Worlds and MaterialsUpdated UI for shaders in the N-PanelQuickSwap (swap active object in viewport to any asset in TA object library)Shader Switch (switch any active shader to one of the other 5)FIXES:Nested collections now supportedFixed and issue with FBX files having wrong case letters in the FBX extension. Now support .fbx in any case e.g .FBX/.fbxFixed and issue with materials not working in EeveeFixed and issue with catalogs sometimes not showing in the dropdownFixed an issue in the HDRI shader to support both full range, and tone-mapped HDRi texturesv4.0.5NEW:Added catalogs from directory structureAdded function to import FBX and OBJ files into one blend for easier editingAdded specular controls to Uber, Plastic, Organic and AmbientCG uber shadersAdded sheen controls to Uber, Plastic and AmbientCG ubder shadersFixes:Change Z location and Z scale were greyed out when toggling the wrong value in shaders. Now greys out and becomes usable when the correct value is toggled (enable Tri-Planar mapping)Materials were broken in Blender 3.3 due to files from 3.4 overwriting the mix nodes. Now have a 3.3 file and 3.4 file to pull from to mitigate this issueFixed Eevee materials not working in some cases, and in other cases Displacement value being changed would break the look of materials.
