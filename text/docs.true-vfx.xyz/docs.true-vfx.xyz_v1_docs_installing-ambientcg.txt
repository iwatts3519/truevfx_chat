The User PreferencesYou MUST go to the [addons] tab of the user preferences after installing True-Assets v4.0. Search for True-Assets and then from there we will address the steps that must be taken to get the AmbientCG library to appear in the Asset-Browser.Step 1:Open the Blender user preferences> Addons > True-Assets (If you have not installed yet, go to HERE)Step 2:Set a download location for the AmbientCG library to store assets you have used (shown in the red box in image above)Step 3:Open the True-Assets Directory location (Shown in yellow box) using the folder button to the right. This will open a file-viewer.Step 4:Either find a location that you wish for your True-Assets libraries to store if you have NOT already done so. OR, if you have already chosen one, just click [OKAY] in that file-viewer pop-up, to refresh True-assets to build the AmbientCG library. Step 5: Save the user preferences (Even if you have auto-save enabled) to ensure that the directories you have set, are set-up within Blender's filepath menu.MUST READYou need to follow these steps as shown, whether this is the first time you have installed True-Assets, or are an existing user of True-Assets. The Libraries will not update without a prompt from the user.The Asset BrowserNow you have completed the steps above, you can head to the Asset-Browser of Blender. Once there, you'll see the dropdowns for all the True-Asset's libraries, now including the AmbientCG library.Once you see this Library in the drop down, select it and follow the Steps on the next articleAmbientCG library not thereIf you can't see the AmbientCG library in the dropdown. Make sure that you have set the paths in the user prefs under True-Assets prefs and saved those preferences. Restart Blender!If you still cannot see them, please contact us on our Discord so we can troubleshoot this with you.
