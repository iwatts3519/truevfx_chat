Asset-Browser utilities           Home Products Support     Beta                 Contents x                True-Assets               Powered by              Asset-Browser utilities 21 Mar 2023          5         Minutes to read                 Contributors                Share this     Print  Share   Dark Light  PDF  Contents   Asset-Browser utilities  Updated on 21 Mar 2023             5            Minutes to read                       Contributors              Print  Share   Dark Light  PDF   Edit Assets (True-Assets)The 'Edit assets' function for True-Assets is designed to provide an easy way for users to be able to access the asset (Object, Material, Collection etc) and make changes to that asset so that those changes will be used going forward. Example use-cases of this:You've noticed an issue with the topology of an object, and don't want to keep changing it every time you bring the asset in. Use the edit Asset function to address the issue at the source so future use of the asset will not use the old broken topologyYou've noticed that an object is coming in with the wrong scale for some reason. Use the edit Asset function to change and then apply the scale at the source so future use of the asset will be at the correct scaleA material that you've saved as an asset may have missing textures. Use the edit Asset function to re-link the textures so future use of the asset will not have missing texturesYou should use this feature if you wish to fix any issues that you see, or wish to make changes to the asset. Bear-in-mind that this is a destructive process and all changes will be permanent.Making changesOnce you have made changes in the source file, you MUST save the file. You do not use the save-as feature, just the normal save function and close the blend-file that you made changes in. Then you need to refresh the asset-browser with the little refresh iconRename AssetsThe 'Rename Assets' function, allows you to either quickly add a prefix (something to the beginning) or a suffix (something to the end) of selected assets (single or batch) and manually replace the current name of the asset too.When you have a selection of assets (either single, or multiple) and use the rename function, a floating window will appear for you to input text to make changes.Single asset renameIf you have only one asset selected for rename, then a box will appear with the option for a prefix, suffix and then you'll see the ""old name/s"" (current name) and an input box for what you want the new name to be.Prefix will append characters or words to the beginning of the current nameSuffix will append characters or words to the end of the current nameNew name will replace the current nameFor example, if you have the object named as ""Tree"" and apply the prefix ""True-VFX_"" and the suffix ""_LOD1"" then this will change the name of the object from ""Tree"" to ""True-VFX_Tree_LOD1""Multiple assets renameIf you have only multiple assets selected for rename, then a box will appear with the option for a prefix, suffix and then you'll see a list of  ""old name/s"" (current name) and an input boxes for what you want the new names to be.Prefix will append characters or words to the beginning of the current nameSuffix will append characters or words to the end of the current nameNew names will replace the current namesFor example, if you have multiple objects named different things, and you wish to standardise these like we do, then you would use a distinguishing prefix like ""True-VFX_"" then press okay, and your list of objects would now be renamed with the changes. Old NamesNew namesCube.001True-VFX_Cube.001Tree.001True-VFX_Tree.001Tree.002True-VFX_Tree.002Suzanne.001True-VFX_Suzanne.001Robot_Final.001True-VFX_Robot_Final.001Car_Audi_Final_SeriousFinal03True-VFX_Car_Audi_Final_SeriousFinal03ReallyWithTheseNames?.001True-VFX_ReallyWithTheseNames?.001CaveatsThings to be aware ofRename function will NOT automatically numerate (001/002/003etc) any renamed assets. If you rename a batch, they will ALL have matching names. Blender will auto-number assets when brought into the scene.Rename function is not designed as a fix for bad/poor naming.Rename function will ONLY rename object names, material names, collection names. It cannot rename mesh dataRename function does NOT rename any of the meta data for assets. You should use the ""update asset data"" function for thisThis is a destructive process. Renaming cannot be undone as the process happens inside the source file which is updated and saved and closed automatically. No history is stored for this!Update Asset DataThe 'Update Asset Data' function is designed to allow the management of Asset-Browser meta-data like tags, descriptions, and Author. This function will amend ALL the selected assets under this process. This process doesn't have any kind of logic to provide context aware descriptions or tags. For example, if you select 5 totally different assets (Trees, cars, buildings) It will NOT know that they are different and cannot selectively tag based on what that asset is. This is a manual process and user-intent is how this process will update the data.TagsThere is no character or word limit on tags. Tags must be separated by a comma (,) if you wish to add multiple tags. You can use spaces and any other character in the words for tags, however a comma will AWLAYS break tags up.Conventionally, you should use separate words to tag things. for example if you wish to tag a selection of tall buildings, then you should not use the tag [Tall Buildings]; you should tag it like this: [Tall],[Building]. Now when you search for Tall OR Building, then they can be indexed correctly and shown to you in a logical manner.Replace or AddThis toggle is for Tags only! This will allow you to batch replace all tags on an asset, or batch add to current tags on an asset.AuthorThis can be any length, but should be used to identify who made the asset. If the asset already has an Author then using whether you have Replace or Add selected, the Author will always be replaced/overwritten. DescriptionThis input box is for adding descriptions to assets. Again this needs user-intent and cannot be dynamic. Whatever you put in this input box, will also always replace the current description that is there. Clear Assets (True-Assets)This function is designed for removing assets, specifically selected/selections of assets.You will need to have assets selected to use this function, or you will not be given the option to use it. If you wish to delete specific types of assets, then use the ""Clear Assets by Type (True-Assets)"" function.Delete DataThis will specifically delete the the actual asset file, and not just unmark it as an asset. For example, using this function on object ""cube.001"" if you check Delete Data, then the cube object will be deleted. If you do not, then the asset will just be cleared (un-asseted) but will remain in the blend file as an object.Delete Linked DataThis will remove any materials, textures, node-groups etc from that asset. For example, if you had object ""cube.001"" and this had a material on called ""material.001"" using textures called ""textures.001"" then bot the material, and those textures would also be deleted from the source file of the asset. Leaving this unchecked could leave those as residual files in that blend file.Delete Blend file if no other asset is found!This does exactly what it says on the tin. If the blend file that houses assets is now completely ""asset"" free, then the blend file will also be deleted. This is a destructive process, and will delete the blend file even if there is other data in it. If that data is not an ""asset"" then it is deemed irrelevant and the file will be deleted anyway.

8,fx.xyz docs create materials,"fx.xyz docs create materials.        Create Materials           Home Products Support     Beta                 Contents x                True-Assets               Powered by              Create Materials 08 Feb 2023          2         Minutes to read                 Contributors                Share this     Print  Share   Dark Light  PDF  Contents   Create Materials  Updated on 08 Feb 2023             2            Minutes to read                       Contributors              Print  Share   Dark Light  PDF   True-Assets allows users to create materials to be used as assets, directly from a directory on your local network/machine. This means you can point this function at a folder of textures which are not already materials, and convert all the raw textures to usable materials inside of Blender.Material Creation LimitationsMaterial creation can only be so accurate in terms of the maps we identify. We use specific tag lookups in texture names to identify what type of maps are being used, and where to plug these into the shader tree. Please bear this in mind if you're using textures that don't follow a conventional naming scheme for their texture maps.The ImporterWhen clicking ""Create Materials"" a file-explorer window will open. Navigate to a directory that has textures in like pictured above. Texture sets should ALWAYS be in their own sub-folder like shown above to work as intended; If texture maps are not organised in such a way, True-Assets may fail this operation.True-Assets will recursively search folders in a downward path to find the texture sets, and then maps it needs to create materials. True-Assets cannot search up a path to find textures. Mark as AssetThis will make sure that all texture maps that are found and converted will be marked for future use in your Asset BrowserCatalogThis dropdown option will allow you to put the chosen .blends into a new or existing catalog.Pack ImagesThis function will pack all textures into the new .blend file that is created in your asset directory. This helps make sure that textures are not lost if you move the source directory. THIS WILL LEAD TO MORE STORAGE BEING USEDShader TypesThere are currently 4 types of shader that can be used. These all have different properties and use-cases.Uber ShaderThis shader is based on the Principled shader workflow, however is set up with a custom node-group which will give options to adjust the effectiveness of your texture maps (For example, you can change the roughness factor of your roughness image map) See Uber shader for more information on this.Plastic ShaderThis shader is based on the Pricipled shader workflow also, however it does not have as broad a range of options, and focuses solely on materials that should have plastic-type properties. (For example, adjusting plastic transparency and Subsurface Scattering) See Plastic shader for more information on this.Organic ShaderThis shader is based on a principled and translucency workflow. This shader works to make organic textures and materials look correct by offering ""translucency"" for making things such as Flora allow light to pass through (used on planar meshes) and for allowing Manifold meshes (meshes with a volume with no holes) let light pass through using the Subsurface Scattering values. See Organic shader for more information on this.Standard ShaderThis shader just uses a basic principled node and connects the maps to the correct inputs. This is not in a node-group and allows for user editing. SearchPopulating this search function will make True-Assets importer ONLY bring in materials with what you have searched for. For example, if you populate this with ""rock"" then only texture sets with the term ""rock"" in their name, will be brought in as assets.Default ValuesThis is so that you can set specific values for the custom shaders on import. When you set these, all the texture sets brought in during this instance of the process will have these values set as their default. This is useful if you have a set of textures that are similar and now what you'd like their global values to be.  Was this article helpful? Yes    No     Thank you for your feedback!

This is the ""Mark asset and quit"" modal and mirrors similar options to the ""mark assets from directory"" function.What to save: Choose between everything in the file, data that is NOT already marked as an asset, or just ALREADY marked assets.Objects: This will open up options for all object types.Thumbnail shading: Choose the type of thumbnail rendering you wish to have between Solid (grey unlit); Material (unlit material preview); Eevee (lit Eevee render); or Cycles (Path traced lit). Choosing between Material, Eevee, and Cycles will provide you with camera options and the option to add a white ground plane. If the ground plane is not chosen, the image will be rendered with a transparent background.Thumbnail RenderingPlease be aware that different render engines may increase the process time. Eevee may not always be the fastest. Cycles can be quicker in come cases.Object Data types: Selecting the following will bring them in to be marked as an asset. (Read below for Kitbash options) Clear materials: This has caused some confusion in the past where users thought this clears the materials from the object, but this is different from what it does. It only removes their asset data, so they don’t appear in the object section of the True-Asset library. Move Origin to Bottom: Enabling this option will identify the lowest face of the object based on its average data and set that point as the origin point.Materials: Selecting this will allow materials to be brought in as their asset type (THIS DOES NOT MEAN THE MATERIALS ALREADY ON OBJECTS): Minimum Nodes: True-Assets tries to avoid materials that it thinks are not important, like default materials and materials with less than a specified number of nodes. You can set this number using this field. Node Groups: Currently, only Shader node groups are supported(though you can save Geometry Node groups by using right-click>’ Mark as Asset’ in the geometry node editor). The thumbnails for Node Groups are rendered using a Shader ball. You can choose the render engine you want to use for thumbnails since some nodes (like bevel) only work in Cycles.Worlds: This will bring in any ""world"" data that was in the source fileCatalog: This dropdown option will allow you to put the chosen .blends into a new or existing catalog.

You can choose the render engine you want to use for thumbnails since some nodes (like bevel) only work in Cycles.Worlds: This will bring in any ""world"" data that was in the source fileKitbash OptionsKitbash AssetsThis function was built to enable easy and fast asset marking for kitbash content from KB3D. Join: This will take all the ""parented"" or ""collections"", which are individual parts of a larger 'piece' and join them together, so they are one singular object. This will stop all the broken parts being imported, which will not come in at their original orientation, meaning you will have to rebuild the larger sets manually.Collection: This will, instead of joining the parts, make them collections (similar to how the KB3D file is set up). Collections cannot be edited once dragged into a scene unless you uncheck the ""instance"" checkmark in the lower left of the 3d viewport.Apply rotation: This will apply the orientation of the content in the source file so that when you save it, it will be the right way up. (We advise keeping this checked)Clear parent: This will clear the parent empties and delete them upon importing. (We advise keeping this checked)   Change displacement type: This will swap the displacement type from ""Displacement"" to ""bump"" this fixes the issues of the mesh edges not lining up. (We advise keeping this checked) Remove Subsurf Modifiers: This will remove any subsurf modifiers applied by KB3D when importing from the source file. This will speed up the process and also make your viewport more performant when using the assets, as the default value enabled by KB3D adds a lot of unnecessary geometry. (We advise keeping this checked)  Data management optionsPack External Data: Pack all the image textures and other data. This helps if you plan to move the source files and their data later, which can break texture paths.Force Regenerate Previews: Some assets can already have custom previews attached to them, so if you don’t want the addon to override them, keep this unchecked.What to do for existing files: These are options for managing potential duplicate data. SKIP will ignore anything that has the same data as assets already in your library; OVERRIDE will overwrite the content already in your asset library if any data matches the new import; CREATE NEW will rename the data to ensure no loss of data or failed imports due to matching data already in your library.

Please ensure that you have followed the steps HERE before continuing.Getting the Library to loadThe AmbientCG library will appear empty on the first time accessing it. This is because we do not pack any of the materials in the addon, and they will be downloaded directly from AmbientCG's server when you drag-and-drop them into a scene.You will first need to Click the [FETCH] button on the top right side of the asset-browser top-menu-bar:Once you have clicked this, you will see on the same bar over to the right, a loading bar appear. This will start the process of downloading the catalog directory, NOT the assets. We only download the material data and icons at this point.Once the Fetch process has complete. The library will then load in the asset-browser workspace. Please give this a moment, it may be slow depending on internet connection speeds, and then for all the icons to load may take some time depending on your CPU/GPU as we need to now store and load all those icons and material details.LibraryOnce the Fetch has comepleted and the Library is loaded, you should see all the materials load in with icons and names. Catalogs will not show yetBecause of how Blender handles the catalog system within the asset-browser, you will likely need to close and restart Blender for the catalog file to be called on, and then organise the content in the catalog panel on the left-side of the asset browser.Once you have loaded the content, and the catalog appear, all the materials will be tagged and can be searched for using either the search bar in the asset browser, or via navigating the catalog menu and scrolling through the asset browser.All materials will be tagged automatically based on the information AmbientCG provides, so you can search keywords for material and sky types.Using the assetsThe assets are easy enough to use. You just select and then drag and drop the assets from the browser into the 3d viewport.For Materials, you must drag and drop these onto objects. They will do nothing if you drag them into empty space in the viewport.For Worlds, you can drag and drop them anywhere in the 3d Viewport and they will apply to the world shader.Extra functionsResolutions and FiletypesThe asset library assets come in different resolutions and file-types. With the asset selected in the browser, the top menu houses dropdowns for changing the quality of that material or world, and also the file-type:Materials usually offer JPG or PNG variant, and between 1k and 16k resolutionsSkies offer between HDR and Tonemapped variants, between 1k and 16k resolutionsDownloaded assetsIf you have used assets previously, then to save on API calls and battering AmbientCG with constant download traffic, we store the contents that you have already pulled in the download folder you should have set-up in the previous article. We offer a way to toggle between these stored assets, and the live assets with a button in the top-menu bar called [Show Downloaded].This button will just toggle the content shown in the asset-browser workspace to the live and downloaded files. You will also see a (downloaded) tag appear in the resolution selector against the resolution of asset you have previously download. Dragging and dropping this asset will not download it again, but will just pull from the already stored file.  Was this article helpful? Yes    No     Thank you for your feedback!

Search for True-Assets and then from there we will address the steps that must be taken to get the AmbientCG library to appear in the Asset-Browser.Step 1:Open the Blender user preferences> Addons > True-Assets (If you have not installed yet, go to HERE)Step 2:Set a download location for the AmbientCG library to store assets you have used (shown in the red box in image above)Step 3:Open the True-Assets Directory location (Shown in yellow box) using the folder button to the right. This will open a file-viewer.Step 4:Either find a location that you wish for your True-Assets libraries to store if you have NOT already done so. OR, if you have already chosen one, just click [OKAY] in that file-viewer pop-up, to refresh True-assets to build the AmbientCG library. Step 5: Save the user preferences (Even if you have auto-save enabled) to ensure that the directories you have set, are set-up within Blender's filepath menu.MUST READYou need to follow these steps as shown, whether this is the first time you have installed True-Assets, or are an existing user of True-Assets. The Libraries will not update without a prompt from the user.The Asset BrowserNow you have completed the steps above, you can head to the Asset-Browser of Blender. Once there, you'll see the dropdowns for all the True-Asset's libraries, now including the AmbientCG library.Once you see this Library in the drop down, select it and follow the Steps on the next articleAmbientCG library not thereIf you can't see the AmbientCG library in the dropdown. Make sure that you have set the paths in the user prefs under True-Assets prefs and saved those preferences.

They keep the site up and running, and produce all the content you see on there in their own time and upload all the content under a cc0 license, meaning that anyone can use the assets for any purpose. This is no simple task and with a library so vast it's hard to do when you're providing all this content for free. We approached Lennart with the proposition of working on a way to integrate their library directly into Blender as we just happened to have a tool that directly integrated with Blender's asset browser.Where to find the Library in True-Assets?AmbientCG LibraryTo find the Ambient CG library, you just head to the Asset-Browser on the dropdown library selector on the left, click this and then select the AmbientCG library.

The ideal use for this material option would be for texture sets like Grass, Leaves and flesh. The shader is broken up into 4 distinct sections, in the UI using drop-down functions. This is to make the UI cleaner and allow the user to close information that is not needed. If you view this in the shader-editor, or the material properties, it will not look like the image on the left but will look like this:We advise using only the options in the UI for convenience. However if you edit the node-group and change any input names, this will break the functions in the UI.Shader BreakdownColourAlbedo HSL (affect trans and sss): This is a 0-1 slider value that will allow for adjustment to Hue, Saturation, and Lightness of the colour map texture. This will Affect the HSL of translucency and SSS (Subsurface Scattering).Hue: This will change the hue (Colour) of the materials albedo/diffuse texture. The default is 0.5 and ranges from 0-1.Saturation: This will increase or decrease the saturation of the albedo/diffuse map. Higher values make the material more vibrant, lower values will remove colour from the material. This ranges from 0-2 with 1 being default.Lightness: This will increase or decrease the visual brightness of the texture. Higher values will make it brighter, while lower values will make it darker. This ranges from 0-2 with 1 being default.SSS Hue and Saturation: This is a 0-1 slider value that will allow for adjustment to Hue and Saturation for ONLY the light that passes through the object/material. SSS Hue: This will change the hue (Colour) of the the light that passes through the object/material.SSS Saturation: This will increase or decrease the saturation of the light that passes through the object/material.Make SSS Human (Blood): This will force the SSS to become red and override any other values set before. This uses physically correct values to show the light passing through skin.AO Map Strenght: If an AO (Ambient Occlusion) map was in the texture set, then this will allow you to adjust that map strength.Explanatory GIFMaterialUse Translucent (Alpha-masked mats only): This is a 0-1 value, it should be either 0 or 1 not in between. This is used for things like leaves to allow light to pass through them. Translucent amount: This is a 0-2 value, with 1 being default. 0 lets no light pass through, while 2 lets the most light pass through. This only works on meshes that are planar and using textures for things like leaves/grass/flowers etc.Translucency ExampleThese values should only be used on meshes that are planar (don't have a volume/non-manifold). Translucency is the correct method to use on these meshes. SSS does not work on meshes with no volume or if they are not manifold meshes (no holes). This is an example of translucency in action:Use Subsurface scattering (manifold only): This is a 0-1 value. It should be either 0, or 1 only. This enables the SSS pass on the shader, which allows light to pass through the mesh based on relative thickness of the mesh. More light will pass through thinner/smaller parts, where less light will pass through thicker parts.SSS Amount: The strength of light passthrough. This is the factor value for SSS and ranges from 0-2 with 1 being default. (This can only be used if you have enabled SSS HSL in the colour tab)Subsurface IOR: This is the index of refraction value for SSS (at which angle light passes through CYCLES ONLY)Subsurface Anistropy: This changes the directionality of the light passing through (CYCLES ONLY).Roughness: This will affect the roughness of the shader based on the roughness map that was applied. This ranges from 0-1 and 0.5 being default (which is the roughness map with no changes applied) Lower values make it glossier, higher values make it rougher.Shiny Spots: This affects the black-clip of the roughness map. Higher values will make the black-levels of the map more obvious, creating patches of higher gloss areas. Higher values may make the whole map dark, which in-turn makes it glossier. This is a 0-1 value.Rough spots: This affects the white-clip of the roughness map. Higher values will make the white-levels of the map more obvious, creating patches of higher rough areas. Higher values may make the whole map light, which in-turn makes it rougher. This is a 0-1 value.Enable Opacity masks: This is on by default, and will make sure any materials that have an alpha mask come in with that mask enabled, allowing for transparent sections.DX to OGL Normals: This value is a 0-1 value, and is set to 0 by default. This will flip the Green channel of a normal map, so that it converts normal maps from Direct X (DX) to OpenGL (OGL) or vice-versa. This should be used if your shadows look wrong or if you know exactly what format the Normal map is in.Explanatory GIFSurfaceNormal map strength: This will affect the intensity of the normal map. 1 is default, and ranges from 0-10. Values can be keyed-in outside of this range, but beware this may provide unwanted results.Bump Strength: This will affect the bump/height map value. This is a 0-1 value.Bump Distance: This changes the perceived height of the bump map. The correct way to use a bump map is to set the strength to 1 and then adjust the intensity with this value. Values equate to Blender units (or whatever you have set units to) for example 0.25 in here would be equivalent to 2.5cm in height. This value is limited to 5 but any value can be keyed in. If you wish to invert the bump, set negative numbers. Displacement Scale: This is the strength of the displacement map. The height of the displacement intensity is the same as the bump in that a value of 0.25 will equate to a 2.5cm displacement value.Displacement Midlevel: This offsets the location at which the displacement will start from. Higher values will make the displaced mesh move inward from it's original volume, lower values will make it move outward from it's original volume.Displacement usageDisplacement of the mesh will ONLY work if you have set the ""experimental"" feature set in the render properties. It is CYCLES ONLY, and there needs to be a subsurface modifier on the object set to ""adaptive"" otherwise this will not work as shown in the GIFExplanatory GIFMappingTri-Planar mapping: This will swap from a UV map, to a projected procedural mapping system that maps directly to the XY and Z coordinated of a mesh. This is useful for removing stretching of textures on objects with high-sloping faces.Seam Blending (only tri-planar mapping): This will blur the visible seams from the Tri-Planar mapping system. This can cause artefacts when using adaptive displacementRotate texture: This rotates textures along their mapped co-ordinates. The values in here should be treated as rotation in degrees. 90, would be a rotation of 90 degrees.Scale textures up: This scales the textures to look larger.Scale X: This will scale textures along the X axis. Higher values mean there will be more repetitions in the texture.Scale Y: This will scale textures along the Y axis. Higher values mean there will be more repetitions in the texture.Scale Z: This will scale textures along the Z axis. This only works when Tri-Planar mapping is enabled as UV maps do not have a Z axiz. They only work along XY (UV). Higher values mean there will be more repetitions in the texture. X Location: This will move the mapped texture along the X axisY Location: This will move the mapped texture along the Y axisZ Location: This will move the mapped texture along the Z axis. This only works with Tri-Planar mapping enabled as a UV map does not have a Z axis.Make Texture Smaller: Increasing this value will increase the AMOUNT of tiles generated. This makes the texture appear smaller as it's scales down to add more tiles in the same mapping coordinates. This affects all previous mapping settings.Explanatory GIFMapping and ScaleIf you make changes to the mapping values, then change the size of the object and apply that scale. Mapping values will adjust automatically based on what the new dimensions are. You may need to re-adjust these values. The advised workflow is to set you object up at the correct scale before applying the material.  Was this article helpful? Yes    No     Thank you for your feedback!

This will not affect maps that are in the greyscale and will have limited effect on dark or very light hues.New Colour: This is a colour picker value. Click this and choose a new colour from the colour wheel. This will only adjust the hue and not the saturation or lightness. You can use this input in the shader editor to add a ""random"" object/particle node, with a colour ramp to give random colours to objects sharing this material.Enable Surface HSL: This is a 0-1 slider that enabled the HSL values to be used.Surface Hue: This will allow you change the hue of the whole diffuse map, this works on hues/colours in any shade, highlight, or saturation. This is a 0-1 value with default at 0.5Surface Saturation: This is a 0-2 value with the default being 1, that will allow for adjustment to Saturation for the diffuse map. Surface Lightness: This will change the lightness of the diffuse map. Lower values will be darker and higher values will be brighter. This is a 0-2 value with default being 1.SubSurface Hue: This will change the colour of the light passing through the object.

Higher values may make the whole map light, which in-turn makes it rougher. This is a 0-1 value.Enable Translucent: This is a 0-1 value, it should be either 0 or 1 not in between. This is used for things like leaves to allow light to pass through them. Translucent amount: This is a 0-10 value, with 1 being default. 0 lets no light pass through, while 10 lets the most light pass through. This is designed to work on ALL mesh types.Translucent Angle: This is a 0-1 value with 0.5 being default. This will refract light through the object. 0 will be a direct pass of light through the mesh from the source of light. (Light is at the top, scatter happens at the bottom). 1 Will refract the light at a complete perpendicular angle of the source. (light is at the top, scatter comes out the sides).Translucent Frosting: This is a 0-1 value with 0 being default. 0 will have a limited ""frosting"" effect on the object; this will have a limited penumbral effect. Setting this to 1 will give a highly ""frosted"" effect of the light scatter, increasing the penumbral effect.Translucent IOR: This is the index of refraction of the light. This is a limited range from 1.250 - 1.600Enable SSS Plastic: This will enable the Subsurface scattering of the mesh. This can only be used on manifold meshes, but can be used with alpha masked maps. SSS Amount: The strength of light passthrough. This is the factor value for SSS and ranges from 0-2 with 1 being default. (This can only be used if you have enabled SSS HSL in the colour tab)Enable Opacity masks: This is on by default, and will make sure any materials that have an alpha mask come in with that mask enabled, allowing for transparent sections.DX to OGL Normals: This value is a 0-1 value, and is set to 0 by default. This will flip the Green channel of a normal map, so that it converts normal maps from Direct X (DX) to OpenGL (OGL) or vice-versa. This should be used if your shadows look wrong or if you know exactly what format the Normal map is in.Explanatory GIFSurfaceNormal map strength: This will affect the intensity of the normal map. 1 is default, and ranges from 0-10. Values can be keyed-in outside of this range, but beware this may provide unwanted results.Bump Strength: This will affect the bump/height map value. This is a 0-1 value.Bump Distance: This changes the perceived height of the bump map. The correct way to use a bump map is to set the strength to 1 and then adjust the intensity with this value. Values equate to Blender units (or whatever you have set units to) for example 0.25 in here would be equivalent to 2.5cm in height. This value is limited to 5 but any value can be keyed in. If you wish to invert the bump, set negative numbers. Displacement Scale: This is the strength of the displacement map. The height of the displacement intensity is the same as the bump in that a value of 0.25 will equate to a 2.5cm displacement value.Displacement Midlevel: This offsets the location at which the displacement will start from. Higher values will make the displaced mesh move inward from it's original volume, lower values will make it move outward from it's original volume.Displacement usageDisplacement of the mesh will ONLY work if you have set the ""experimental"" feature set in the render properties. It is CYCLES ONLY, and there needs to be a subsurface modifier on the object set to ""adaptive"" otherwise this will not work as shown in the GIFExplanatory GIFMappingTri-Planar mapping: This will swap from a UV map, to a projected procedural mapping system that maps directly to the XY and Z coordinated of a mesh. This is useful for removing stretching of textures on objects with high-sloping faces.Seam Blending (only tri-planar mapping): This will blur the visible seams from the Tri-Planar mapping system. This can cause artefacts when using adaptive displacementRotate texture: This rotates textures along their mapped co-ordinates. The values in here should be treated as rotation in degrees. 90, would be a rotation of 90 degrees.Scale textures up: This scales the textures to look larger.Scale X: This will scale textures along the X axis. Higher values mean there will be more repetitions in the texture.Scale Y: This will scale textures along the Y axis. Higher values mean there will be more repetitions in the texture.Scale Z: This will scale textures along the Z axis. This only works when Tri-Planar mapping is enabled as UV maps do not have a Z axiz. They only work along XY (UV). Higher values mean there will be more repetitions in the texture. X Location: This will move the mapped texture along the X axisY Location: This will move the mapped texture along the Y axisZ Location: This will move the mapped texture along the Z axis. This only works with Tri-Planar mapping enabled as a UV map does not have a Z axis.Make Texture Smaller: Increasing this value will increase the AMOUNT of tiles generated. This makes the texture appear smaller as it's scales down to add more tiles in the same mapping coordinates. This affects all previous mapping settings.Explanatory GIFMapping and ScaleIf you make changes to the mapping values, then change the size of the object and apply that scale. Mapping values will adjust automatically based on what the new dimensions are. You may need to re-adjust these values. The advised workflow is to set you object up at the correct scale before applying the material.  Was this article helpful? Yes    No     Thank you for your feedback!

As a result, the team was constantly iterating on features and implementing changes in a fast-paced environment. With the focus on moving quickly and innovating, documentation took a backseat. While this approach can yield exciting results, it also means that tracking changes and documenting them in a formal way often fell by the wayside. As such, there are no official changelogs available for earlier versions of the software. However, the development team has since recognized the importance of thorough documentation and made it a priority moving forward.But let's be honest, we humans have a tendency to forget things anyway, so who knows if a changelog would have made much of a difference.

The ideal use for this material option would be for texture sets like raw/painted metals, rocks, grounds, hard surfaces like concrete or marble. The shader is broken up into 4 distinct sections, in the UI using drop-down functions. This is to make the UI cleaner and allow the user to close information that is not needed. If you view this in the shader-editor, or the material properties, it will not look like the image on the left but will look like this:We advise using only the options in the UI for convenience. However if you edit the node-group and change any input names, this will break the functions in the UI.Shader BreakdownColourEnable Colour Changes: This is a 0-1 slider value that will allow for adjustment directly to the HUE's on the diffuse/albedo map. This will not affect maps that are in the greyscale and will have limited effect on dark or very light hues.Metal Colour: This is a colour picker value. Click this and choose a new colour from the colour wheel. This will only adjust the hue of the material based on the METALLIC map values. This means it'll only affect the metal parts of a material.Metal Lightness: This is used to make the metal colour lighter or darker. Ranges from 0-2 and default at 1Non-Metal Colour: This is a colour picker value. Click this and choose a new colour from the colour wheel. This will only adjust the hue of the material based on the NON-METALLIC map values. This means it'll only affect the metal parts of a material. Non-Metal Lightness: This is used to make the metal colour lighter or darker. Ranges from 0-2 and default at 1AO Map Strength: This will affect the intensity of an AO map if detected.Explanatory GIFTwo texture types to show how different settings affect textures using Uber-Shader (Drivers are not enabled by default. This has been done for demo purposes) MaterialMetallic-ness: This will adjust the metal values in the shader. If there are ""metal"" areas, then you can make these non-metal by setting the value to 0. If you wish to make non-metallic materials more metallic, then set this between 0.5 and 1Metal Spots: This will attempt to change how the metallic map effects the shader. If the map has enough range in it, then this value will show more visible metal areas. This may be best seen when roughness or rough/shiny spot values have been adjusted. If the Metallic map is a pure black and white map with no range between those values, then this will not work.Non Metal spots: This will do the same as the above value, but for the non-metal masked sections of the metallic map.Roughness: This will affect the roughness of the shader based on the roughness map that was applied. This ranges from 0-1 and 0.5 being default (which is the roughness map with no changes applied) Lower values make it glossier, and higher values make it rougher.Shiny Spots: This affects the black-clip of the roughness map. Higher values will make the black-levels of the map more obvious, creating patches of higher gloss areas. Higher values may make the whole map dark, which in turn makes it glossier. This is a 0-1 value.Rough spots: This affects the white-clip of the roughness map. Higher values will make the white-levels of the map more obvious, creating patches of higher rough areas. Higher values may make the whole map light, which in turn makes it rougher. This is a 0-1 value.Anisotropic: This will enable the Anisotropy Value in the shader. See more information HEREEnable Opacity masks: This is on by default and will make sure any materials that have an alpha mask come in with that mask enabled, allowing for transparent sections.DX to OGL Normals: This value is a 0-1 value, and is set to 0 by default. This will flip the Green channel of a normal map so that it converts normal maps from Direct X (DX) to OpenGL (OGL) or vice-versa. This should be used if your shadows look wrong or if you know exactly what format the Normal map is in.Explanatory GIFSurfaceNormal map strength: This will affect the intensity of the normal map. 1 is default, and ranges from 0-10. Values can be keyed-in outside of this range, but beware this may provide unwanted results.Bump Strength: This will affect the bump/height map value. This is a 0-1 value.Bump Distance: This changes the perceived height of the bump map. The correct way to use a bump map is to set the strength to 1 and then adjust the intensity with this value. Values equate to Blender units (or whatever you have set units to) for example 0.25 in here would be equivalent to 2.5cm in height. This value is limited to 5 but any value can be keyed in.

Disable if you wish to make everything compatible to be marked in the chosen .blend files.FiltersWhat to save: Choose between everything in the file, data that is NOT already marked as an asset, or just ALREADY marked assets.Objects: This will open up options for all object types.Thumbnail shading: Choose the type of thumbnail rendering you wish to have between Solid (grey unlit); Material (unlit material preview); Eevee (lit Eevee render); or Cycles (Path traced lit). Choosing between Material, Eevee, and Cycles will provide you with camera options and the option to add a white ground plane. If the ground plane is not chosen, the image will be rendered with a transparent background.Thumbnail RenderingPlease be aware that different render engines may increase the process time. Eevee may not always be the fastest. Cycles can be quicker in come cases.Object Data types:Selecting the following will bring them in to be marked as an asset. (Read below for Kitbash options) Clear materials: This has caused some confusion in the past where users thought this clears the materials from the object, but this is different from what it does. It only removes their asset data, so they don’t appear in the object section of the True-Asset library. Move Origin to Bottom: Enabling this option will identify the lowest face of the object based on its average data and set that point as the origin point.Materials: Selecting this will allow materials to be brought in as their asset type (THIS DOES NOT MEAN THE MATERIALS ALREADY ON OBJECTS): Minimum Nodes: True-Assets tries to avoid materials that it thinks are not important, like default materials and materials with less than a specified number of nodes. You can set this number using this field. Node Groups: Currently, only Shader node groups are supported(though you can save Geometry Node groups by using right-click>’ Mark as Asset’ in the geometry node editor). The thumbnails for Node Groups are rendered using a Shader ball. You can choose the render engine you want to use for thumbnails since some nodes (like bevel) only work in Cycles.Worlds: This will bring in any ""world"" data that was in the source fileKitbash OptionsKitbash AssetsThis function was built to enable easy and fast asset marking for kitbash content from KB3D. Join: This will take all the ""parented"" or ""collections"", which are individual parts of a larger 'piece' and join them together, so they are one singular object. This will stop all the broken parts being imported, which will not come in at their original orientation, meaning you will have to rebuild the larger sets manually.Collection: This will, instead of joining the parts, make them collections (similar to how the KB3D file is set up). Collections cannot be edited once dragged into a scene unless you uncheck the ""instance"" checkmark in the lower left of the 3d viewport.Apply rotation: This will apply the orientation of the content in the source file so that when you save it, it will be the right way up. (We advise keeping this checked)Clear parent: This will clear the parent empties and delete them upon importing. (We advise keeping this checked)   Change displacement type: This will swap the displacement type from ""Displacement"" to ""bump"" this fixes the issues of the mesh edges not lining up. (We advise keeping this checked) Remove Subsurf Modifiers: This will remove any subsurf modifiers applied by KB3D when importing from the source file. This will speed up the process and also make your viewport more performant when using the assets, as the default value enabled by KB3D adds a lot of unnecessary geometry. (We advise keeping this checked)  Data management optionsPack External Data: Pack all the image textures and other data. This helps if you plan to move the source files and their data later, which can break texture paths.Force Regenerate Previews: Some assets can already have custom previews attached to them, so if you don’t want the addon to override them, keep this unchecked.What to do for existing files: These are options for managing potential duplicate data. SKIP will ignore anything that has the same data as assets already in your library; OVERRIDE will overwrite the content already in your asset library if any data matches the new import; CREATE NEW will rename the data to ensure no loss of data or failed imports due to matching data already in your library.

The ideal use for this material option would be for texture sets like Grass, Leaves and flesh. The shader is broken up into 4 distinct sections, in the UI using drop-down functions. This is to make the UI cleaner and allow the user to close information that is not needed. If you view this in the shader-editor, or the material properties, it will not look like the image on the left but will look like this:We advise using only the options in the UI for convenience. However if you edit the node-group and change any input names, this will break the functions in the UI.Shader BreakdownColourAlbedo HSL (affect trans and sss): This is a 0-1 slider value that will allow for adjustment to Hue, Saturation, and Lightness of the colour map texture. This will Affect the HSL of translucency and SSS (Subsurface Scattering).Hue: This will change the hue (Colour) of the materials albedo/diffuse texture. The default is 0.5 and ranges from 0-1.Saturation: This will increase or decrease the saturation of the albedo/diffuse map. Higher values make the material more vibrant, lower values will remove colour from the material. This ranges from 0-2 with 1 being default.Lightness: This will increase or decrease the visual brightness of the texture. Higher values will make it brighter, while lower values will make it darker. This ranges from 0-2 with 1 being default.SSS Hue and Saturation: This is a 0-1 slider value that will allow for adjustment to Hue and Saturation for ONLY the light that passes through the object/material. SSS Hue: This will change the hue (Colour) of the the light that passes through the object/material.SSS Saturation: This will increase or decrease the saturation of the light that passes through the object/material.Make SSS Human (Blood): This will force the SSS to become red and override any other values set before. This uses physically correct values to show the light passing through skin.AO Map Strenght: If an AO (Ambient Occlusion) map was in the texture set, then this will allow you to adjust that map strength.Explanatory GIFMaterialUse Translucent (Alpha-masked mats only): This is a 0-1 value, it should be either 0 or 1 not in between. This is used for things like leaves to allow light to pass through them. Translucent amount: This is a 0-2 value, with 1 being default. 0 lets no light pass through, while 2 lets the most light pass through. This only works on meshes that are planar and using textures for things like leaves/grass/flowers etc.Translucency ExampleThese values should only be used on meshes that are planar (don't have a volume/non-manifold). Translucency is the correct method to use on these meshes. SSS does not work on meshes with no volume or if they are not manifold meshes (no holes). This is an example of translucency in action:Use Subsurface scattering (manifold only): This is a 0-1 value. It should be either 0, or 1 only. This enables the SSS pass on the shader, which allows light to pass through the mesh based on relative thickness of the mesh. More light will pass through thinner/smaller parts, where less light will pass through thicker parts.SSS Amount: The strength of light passthrough. This is the factor value for SSS and ranges from 0-2 with 1 being default. (This can only be used if you have enabled SSS HSL in the colour tab)Subsurface IOR: This is the index of refraction value for SSS (at which angle light passes through CYCLES ONLY)Subsurface Anistropy: This changes the directionality of the light passing through (CYCLES ONLY).Roughness: This will affect the roughness of the shader based on the roughness map that was applied. This ranges from 0-1 and 0.5 being default (which is the roughness map with no changes applied) Lower values make it glossier, higher values make it rougher.Shiny Spots: This affects the black-clip of the roughness map. Higher values will make the black-levels of the map more obvious, creating patches of higher gloss areas. Higher values may make the whole map dark, which in-turn makes it glossier. This is a 0-1 value.Rough spots: This affects the white-clip of the roughness map. Higher values will make the white-levels of the map more obvious, creating patches of higher rough areas. Higher values may make the whole map light, which in-turn makes it rougher. This is a 0-1 value.Enable Opacity masks: This is on by default, and will make sure any materials that have an alpha mask come in with that mask enabled, allowing for transparent sections.DX to OGL Normals: This value is a 0-1 value, and is set to 0 by default. This will flip the Green channel of a normal map, so that it converts normal maps from Direct X (DX) to OpenGL (OGL) or vice-versa. This should be used if your shadows look wrong or if you know exactly what format the Normal map is in.Explanatory GIFSurfaceNormal map strength: This will affect the intensity of the normal map. 1 is default, and ranges from 0-10. Values can be keyed-in outside of this range, but beware this may provide unwanted results.Bump Strength: This will affect the bump/height map value. This is a 0-1 value.Bump Distance: This changes the perceived height of the bump map. The correct way to use a bump map is to set the strength to 1 and then adjust the intensity with this value. Values equate to Blender units (or whatever you have set units to) for example 0.25 in here would be equivalent to 2.5cm in height. This value is limited to 5 but any value can be keyed in. If you wish to invert the bump, set negative numbers. Displacement Scale: This is the strength of the displacement map. The height of the displacement intensity is the same as the bump in that a value of 0.25 will equate to a 2.5cm displacement value.Displacement Midlevel: This offsets the location at which the displacement will start from. Higher values will make the displaced mesh move inward from it's original volume, lower values will make it move outward from it's original volume.Displacement usageDisplacement of the mesh will ONLY work if you have set the ""experimental"" feature set in the render properties. It is CYCLES ONLY, and there needs to be a subsurface modifier on the object set to ""adaptive"" otherwise this will not work as shown in the GIFExplanatory GIFMappingTri-Planar mapping: This will swap from a UV map, to a projected procedural mapping system that maps directly to the XY and Z coordinated of a mesh. This is useful for removing stretching of textures on objects with high-sloping faces.Seam Blending (only tri-planar mapping): This will blur the visible seams from the Tri-Planar mapping system. This can cause artefacts when using adaptive displacementRotate texture: This rotates textures along their mapped co-ordinates. The values in here should be treated as rotation in degrees. 90, would be a rotation of 90 degrees.Scale textures up: This scales the textures to look larger.Scale X: This will scale textures along the X axis. Higher values mean there will be more repetitions in the texture.Scale Y: This will scale textures along the Y axis. Higher values mean there will be more repetitions in the texture.Scale Z: This will scale textures along the Z axis. This only works when Tri-Planar mapping is enabled as UV maps do not have a Z axiz. They only work along XY (UV). Higher values mean there will be more repetitions in the texture. X Location: This will move the mapped texture along the X axisY Location: This will move the mapped texture along the Y axisZ Location: This will move the mapped texture along the Z axis. This only works with Tri-Planar mapping enabled as a UV map does not have a Z axis.Make Texture Smaller: Increasing this value will increase the AMOUNT of tiles generated. This makes the texture appear smaller as it's scales down to add more tiles in the same mapping coordinates. This affects all previous mapping settings.Explanatory GIFMapping and ScaleIf you make changes to the mapping values, then change the size of the object and apply that scale. Mapping values will adjust automatically based on what the new dimensions are. You may need to re-adjust these values. The advised workflow is to set you object up at the correct scale before applying the material.  Was this article helpful? Yes    No     Thank you for your feedback!

However if you edit the node-group and change any input names, this will break the functions in the UI.Shader BreakdownColourEnable Colour Changes: This is a 0-1 slider value that will allow for adjustment directly to the HUE's on the diffuse/albedo map. This will not affect maps that are in the greyscale and will have limited effect on dark or very light hues.New Colour: This is a colour picker value. Click this and choose a new colour from the colour wheel. This will only adjust the hue and not the saturation or lightness. You can use this input in the shader editor to add a ""random"" object/particle node, with a colour ramp to give random colours to objects sharing this material.Enable Surface HSL: This is a 0-1 slider that enabled the HSL values to be used.Surface Hue: This will allow you change the hue of the whole diffuse map, this works on hues/colours in any shade, highlight, or saturation. This is a 0-1 value with default at 0.5Surface Saturation: This is a 0-2 value with the default being 1, that will allow for adjustment to Saturation for the diffuse map. Surface Lightness: This will change the lightness of the diffuse map. Lower values will be darker and higher values will be brighter. This is a 0-2 value with default being 1.SubSurface Hue: This will change the colour of the light passing through the object. This affects light either with SSS enabled or Translucency enabled.SubSurface Saturation: This will affect the saturation of the light that passes through the object. This affects light either with SSS enabled or Translucency enabled. AO Map Strength: If an AO (Ambient Occlusion) map was in the texture set, then this will allow you to adjust that map strength.Explanatory GIFMaterialRoughness: This will affect the roughness of the shader based on the roughness map that was applied.

This is used for things like leaves to allow light to pass through them. Translucent amount: This is a 0-10 value, with 1 being default. 0 lets no light pass through, while 10 lets the most light pass through. This is designed to work on ALL mesh types.Translucent Angle: This is a 0-1 value with 0.5 being default. This will refract light through the object. 0 will be a direct pass of light through the mesh from the source of light. (Light is at the top, scatter happens at the bottom). 1 Will refract the light at a complete perpendicular angle of the source. (light is at the top, scatter comes out the sides).Translucent Frosting: This is a 0-1 value with 0 being default. 0 will have a limited ""frosting"" effect on the object; this will have a limited penumbral effect. Setting this to 1 will give a highly ""frosted"" effect of the light scatter, increasing the penumbral effect.Translucent IOR: This is the index of refraction of the light. This is a limited range from 1.250 - 1.600Enable SSS Plastic: This will enable the Subsurface scattering of the mesh. This can only be used on manifold meshes, but can be used with alpha masked maps. SSS Amount: The strength of light passthrough.

Values equate to Blender units (or whatever you have set units to) for example 0.25 in here would be equivalent to 2.5cm in height. This value is limited to 5 but any value can be keyed in. If you wish to invert the bump, set negative numbers. Displacement Scale: This is the strength of the displacement map. The height of the displacement intensity is the same as the bump in that a value of 0.25 will equate to a 2.5cm displacement value.Displacement Midlevel: This offsets the location at which the displacement will start from. Higher values will make the displaced mesh move inward from it's original volume, lower values will make it move outward from it's original volume.Displacement usageDisplacement of the mesh will ONLY work if you have set the ""experimental"" feature set in the render properties. It is CYCLES ONLY, and there needs to be a subsurface modifier on the object set to ""adaptive"" otherwise this will not work as shown in the GIFExplanatory GIFMappingTri-Planar mapping: This will swap from a UV map, to a projected procedural mapping system that maps directly to the XY and Z coordinated of a mesh. This is useful for removing stretching of textures on objects with high-sloping faces.Seam Blending (only tri-planar mapping): This will blur the visible seams from the Tri-Planar mapping system. This can cause artefacts when using adaptive displacementRotate texture: This rotates textures along their mapped co-ordinates. The values in here should be treated as rotation in degrees. 90, would be a rotation of 90 degrees.Scale textures up: This scales the textures to look larger.Scale X: This will scale textures along the X axis. Higher values mean there will be more repetitions in the texture.Scale Y: This will scale textures along the Y axis. Higher values mean there will be more repetitions in the texture.Scale Z: This will scale textures along the Z axis. This only works when Tri-Planar mapping is enabled as UV maps do not have a Z axiz. They only work along XY (UV). Higher values mean there will be more repetitions in the texture. X Location: This will move the mapped texture along the X axisY Location: This will move the mapped texture along the Y axisZ Location: This will move the mapped texture along the Z axis. This only works with Tri-Planar mapping enabled as a UV map does not have a Z axis.Make Texture Smaller: Increasing this value will increase the AMOUNT of tiles generated. This makes the texture appear smaller as it's scales down to add more tiles in the same mapping coordinates. This affects all previous mapping settings.Explanatory GIFMapping and ScaleIf you make changes to the mapping values, then change the size of the object and apply that scale. Mapping values will adjust automatically based on what the new dimensions are. You may need to re-adjust these values. The advised workflow is to set you object up at the correct scale before applying the material.  Was this article helpful? Yes    No     Thank you for your feedback!

The ideal use for this material option would be for texture sets like raw/painted metals, rocks, grounds, hard surfaces like concrete or marble. The shader is broken up into 4 distinct sections, in the UI using drop-down functions. This is to make the UI cleaner and allow the user to close information that is not needed. If you view this in the shader-editor, or the material properties, it will not look like the image on the left but will look like this:We advise using only the options in the UI for convenience. However if you edit the node-group and change any input names, this will break the functions in the UI.Shader BreakdownColourEnable Colour Changes: This is a 0-1 slider value that will allow for adjustment directly to the HUE's on the diffuse/albedo map. This will not affect maps that are in the greyscale and will have limited effect on dark or very light hues.Metal Colour: This is a colour picker value. Click this and choose a new colour from the colour wheel. This will only adjust the hue of the material based on the METALLIC map values. This means it'll only affect the metal parts of a material.Metal Lightness: This is used to make the metal colour lighter or darker. Ranges from 0-2 and default at 1Non-Metal Colour: This is a colour picker value. Click this and choose a new colour from the colour wheel. This will only adjust the hue of the material based on the NON-METALLIC map values. This means it'll only affect the metal parts of a material. Non-Metal Lightness: This is used to make the metal colour lighter or darker. Ranges from 0-2 and default at 1AO Map Strength: This will affect the intensity of an AO map if detected.Explanatory GIFTwo texture types to show how different settings affect textures using Uber-Shader (Drivers are not enabled by default. This has been done for demo purposes) MaterialMetallic-ness: This will adjust the metal values in the shader. If there are ""metal"" areas, then you can make these non-metal by setting the value to 0. If you wish to make non-metallic materials more metallic, then set this between 0.5 and 1Metal Spots: This will attempt to change how the metallic map effects the shader. If the map has enough range in it, then this value will show more visible metal areas. This may be best seen when roughness or rough/shiny spot values have been adjusted. If the Metallic map is a pure black and white map with no range between those values, then this will not work.Non Metal spots: This will do the same as the above value, but for the non-metal masked sections of the metallic map.Roughness: This will affect the roughness of the shader based on the roughness map that was applied. This ranges from 0-1 and 0.5 being default (which is the roughness map with no changes applied) Lower values make it glossier, and higher values make it rougher.Shiny Spots: This affects the black-clip of the roughness map. Higher values will make the black-levels of the map more obvious, creating patches of higher gloss areas. Higher values may make the whole map dark, which in turn makes it glossier. This is a 0-1 value.Rough spots: This affects the white-clip of the roughness map. Higher values will make the white-levels of the map more obvious, creating patches of higher rough areas. Higher values may make the whole map light, which in turn makes it rougher. This is a 0-1 value.Anisotropic: This will enable the Anisotropy Value in the shader. See more information HEREEnable Opacity masks: This is on by default and will make sure any materials that have an alpha mask come in with that mask enabled, allowing for transparent sections.DX to OGL Normals: This value is a 0-1 value, and is set to 0 by default. This will flip the Green channel of a normal map so that it converts normal maps from Direct X (DX) to OpenGL (OGL) or vice-versa. This should be used if your shadows look wrong or if you know exactly what format the Normal map is in.Explanatory GIFSurfaceNormal map strength: This will affect the intensity of the normal map. 1 is default, and ranges from 0-10. Values can be keyed-in outside of this range, but beware this may provide unwanted results.Bump Strength: This will affect the bump/height map value.

What Customers Says About Us    Test sentence describing a test of words and how those words are written down in a paragraph designed to make people reading with absolutely no end goal... test, CEO     I am a 3D designer that was new to Blender. I was interested in landscape design and wanted to take out the difficult parts to include shaders and assets. I purchased True Terrain and haven't looked back. The amount of work that Rich and Zeastin (Zach) have put into this addon is amazing. They are not only creating an amazing plugin with tons of content but also listening to the community at how things can be made easier and better. I believe customer support is key to any company and will make sure it goes a long way. If you are a blender user and have any need for any type of landscape work then you need True Terrain in your addons.Instagram Mike Carnevale, Professional Photographer and CG Hobbyist   How can we be cheaper than other asset sites?

How do we make money with that? all very good questions. The Lifetime subscription, is literally that; You pay us once, and never again, and FOREVER, you can access our site, and download as much content as you want, whenever you want, from any of our Textures, Models and VDB sections.The reason we offer this is simple. It gives you, the chance to invest in us early, which will allow us to put money back into the site, by hiring new texture artists, or photogrammetry artists, equipment and infrastructure. You get a good deal, with a load of content to download right off the bat, and no risk to you. How we make money is also, really simple. We offer this only, twice a year, for 31 days. We increase the price, as our amount of content goes up, but at a rate that amounts to being still a great deal for the user, and each time we do this, we will hopefully make enough money from those sales, that we can rapidly invest back into increasing our content and services. Keeping costs down! We do a lot to make sure that we're not overcharging people. A big factor in this, is how much it actually costs us, to produce content.A key factor in the pricing of other asset sites, is workforce. The bigger the workforce, the more money goes into them, means the more money needs to come from consumers, to fund that workforce. Another key factor, is 'Brick and Mortar' costs; this is the cost of actual buildings, for things like offices, needed to house the workforce. Well, we don't have a very big workforce. And for any work we do need to do, we decide on whether that work needs to be done by us, or whether we can freelance someone else to do the work. Need to build an addon? That's us; Need some photographs of textures from around the world? Freelance it. There's no valid reason (outside of travelling the world) that we need to charge you guys, the fees, associated with sending staff all over the world. We sell digital content, on a digital platform, for us on digital programs. So why invest in unnecessary analogue assets, like office spaces, travelling and whatever else. We all have a computer and access to the internet. May as well make use of it, and keep the cost to you down.   Why? We love what we do, we love the people we do it for, and we love the people we do it with. We're not here to make a quick-buck and run. We're in this for the long-haul, so we can be sure when we say, we promise to give you the best we can.

The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like). Why do we use it? There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc. Leave Your Comment  Submit Comment  Comments No comments.
